# Setting up a Simple Django Server

This guide will walk you through setting up a simple Django server with a single app.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Then, install Django using pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

## Project Setup

1. **Create a Django Project**: 
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject my_project
    ```

2. **Create a Django App**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py startapp my_app
    ```

## Define Views

Inside the `my_app` folder, create a file called `views.py` and define your views. For example:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the index.")
```

## Define URL Patterns

In the `urls.py` file inside your `my_app` folder, map URLs to views. For example:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

## Include App URLs in Project URLs

In the `urls.py` file inside your `my_project` folder, include the URL patterns from your app. For example:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('my_app.urls')),
]
```

## Running the Server

To run your Django development server, execute the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start a development server on your local machine, and you can access your application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
